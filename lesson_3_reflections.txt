When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When other contributors using different laptop or locations need to contribute to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	There might be changes that I don't wish to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks is specifically refer to Github. It is like cloning it to your own account in GitHub. Clones refers to cloning a repository - can be among locals or from remote repository to local. Branches can be used when you want to test out certain new features without affecting the master or working copy.
