When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When other contributors using different laptop or locations need to contribute to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	There might be changes that I don't wish to pull.
